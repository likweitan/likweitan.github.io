# Verify that the latest version of Java is installed Java

Open a command window and enter the command java -version. If a version number is reported, then check the Java website to see what the most recent version number is.

```
C:> java -version
java version "1.8.0_241"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_241-b07)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.241-b07, mixed mode)
```

> If Java isn't installed or the version is outdated, download it from [here](http://www.java.com/download/).

# Starting the Minecraft Server

## Start the Server with `start.bat`

You can now access the server via `localhost`.

> Note: This is only for local network access.

# How to Find Your IP Address

## 1. Open the Command Prompt (cmd).  
## 2. Enter `ipconfig`.  
## 3. Look for the `IPv4 Address`â€”this is your local network IP.

In my case, the IP address is `172.18.140.51`, as shown below:
